# Incognito Shell V1

I coded this for fun and as a challenge as I was learning PHP. Don't be stupid with this. 

## Login

There is a hidden password field hidden in this 404 page (shown in the image below). 
The default password is inc0gnit0 and can be changed in the file `$setpass = "NEWPASSWORD";`
