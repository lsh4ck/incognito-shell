#Incognito Shell V1
It's still in the early stages of development and was originally created as a challenge while I was learning PHP. If you'd like to help code this shell and help further its development, then please contact me on Twitter or email me: incognitoshell@protonmail.com

The author of this shell is not responsible for any ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. This was coded as a challenge and to be used responsibly. Do not do anything stupid. 

##Login
There is a hidden password field hidden in this 404 page (shown in the image below).
